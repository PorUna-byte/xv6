Assume we have two threads thread_A, thread_B:
 They excute concurrently, chances are that the following execution flow may happen:
 thread_A: insert(key_A,value_A,&table[i],table[i])
 thread_B: insert(key_B,value_B,&table[i],table[i])
 thread_A: *p = e which is table[i]={key_A,value_A}
 thread_B: *p = e which is table[i]={key_B,value_B}

 now we see, {key_A,value_A} has been overwritten by {key_B,value_B} !
 that is {key_A,value_A} is lost!
